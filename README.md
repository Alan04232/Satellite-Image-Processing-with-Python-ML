# üöÄ Satellite Image Processing with Python & ML (Cloud-Ready)

This project develops pipelines for processing astronomical images from **JWST**, **Hubble**, and other space telescopes using **Python** and **Machine Learning**. It covers preprocessing, classification, and denoising, with a cloud-based deployment for scalable research, visualization, and collaboration.

## üìñ Project Description  
The aim of this repository is to create an **open-source research framework** where students, researchers, and astronomy enthusiasts can:  
- Access and preprocess raw satellite datasets (FITS format).  
- Train and test ML models for galaxy/object classification, noise reduction, and brightness/redshift prediction.  
- Deploy pipelines into **cloud environments** for collaboration and real-time visualization.

## üìå Project Goals
- Process raw telescope data (FITS format).  
- Apply image preprocessing (noise reduction, normalization, feature extraction).  
- Train ML/DL models: CNNs, Autoencoders, Regression.  
- Deploy workflows in the cloud for scalable use.  
- Provide visualization dashboards for exploration.
